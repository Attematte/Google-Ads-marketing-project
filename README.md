# Google-Ads-marketing-project
Marketing project done on Google Ads. In this project, I created marketing campaigns that were launched on YouTube with 1000â‚¬ budget. 
The goal of this campaign was to get as much visibility as possible for the employer's music video. In addition, one of the project's goals was to get a better picture of the potential target audience. The biggest problem with the previous marketing campaigns was that there was no target audience, but the ads were aimed globally at everyone. To make the campaigns more effective, we decided to map the target audience and reach only such people who listen the kind of music that the employer makes. In other words, we wanted the campaign ads to be more personal and aimed at a more specific target audience.

First I created two test campaigns to gain better insights of the target audience and analyzed the data to create the main campaign. Each of test campaigns included different targeting options. Google Ads allows marketers to use multiple different targeting options and I wanted to know what targeting options works best with our Ads. I could have started without any test campaigns, but that could have been risky and expensive, since we didn't know what targeting options work and how the advertisement performs with these targeting options.
