# Google-Ads-marketing-project
Marketing project done on Google Ads. In this project, I created marketing campaigns that were launched on YouTube with nearly a 2000€ budget. 
The goal of this campaign was to get as much visibility and views as possible for the employer's music video. In addition, one of the project's goals was to get a better picture of the potential target audience. The employer had done marketing on Google Ads before, but the biggest problem with the previous marketing campaigns was that there was no target audience, but the ads were aimed globally at everyone. To make the campaigns more effective, we decided to map the target audience and reach only such people who listen the kind of music that the employer makes. In other words, we wanted the campaign ads to be more personal and aimed at a more specific target audience.

## Creating the test campaigns

First I created two test campaigns to gain better insights of the target audience and analyzed the data to create the main campaign.  Google Ads allows marketers to use multiple different targeting options and I wanted to know what targeting options works best with our Ads. Each  test campaign included different targeting options, however we mostly targeted different countries. I could have started without any test campaigns, but that could have been risky and expensive, since we didn't know what targeting options work and how the advertisement performs with these targeting options.

### Google Ads allows to target audiences based on geographic locations.

The test campaigns were set to target different countries, the first test campaign targeted countries such as America and latin countries whereas the second test campaing was targeting countries in Africa. The countries were selected based on the idea that people in these countries listen the kind of music we are promoting.

### Some additional targeting options that one can use on Google Ads. 

As one can see, one can use several different targeting options when it comes to creating ads. However, at first we did not use any additional targeting options for the test campaings, since we wanted to get a better understanding of the audience. 

## Results of the test campaings

After creating the test campaings, I let them run for three days with a daily budget of 10€/day. After analyzing the data I came to a conclusion that our target audience was people between ages 18 to 44. In fact, males between age 25-34, were the ones who viewed our advertisement the most.

We could also see that most of the people were watching our advertisement on their phones, whereas not so much on tablets.

The picture bellow shows the results from the first test campaign. As we can see, the viewrate is already quite good. Viewrate is a ratio showing the number of paid views of a video ad to the number of impressions that were eligible for views. The viewrate is calculated simply by dividing the amount of views with the amount of impressions, here (7.11/18.4)*100 = 38.62%. Impressions mean how often the ad was shown to the audience.

## Creating the main campaign

For the main campaign, I used the demographic data and geographical data that I got from the test campaigns. In addition, I used a targeting option that places the advertisement on YouTube Channels/videos. This way I could place the advertisement on channels and videos of artists that produce similar kind of music than my employer. The benefit of doing this, is that we were able to reach audience that listened similar kind of music that we wanted to promote with our advertisement.
